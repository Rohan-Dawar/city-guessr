# Rohan's City Guesser

A game in which you must guess what city you are being shown!

## Getting Started

1. [Create a Reddit API Account](https://www.reddit.com/dev/api/)
2. Add your Reddit API Account Details to prawKeys.py
3. Run game.py
4. On your browser, navigate to your localhost with port 5000: localhost:5000

### Prerequisites

To run game.py you will need [Pyhton 3.0+](https://www.python.org/) installed.

## How to Play

- Upon loading you will see a photo of a city, with an entry field above and a scoreboard below.
- Type in the entry field your guess for what city it is
  - abbreviations **should** work ie. 'nyc' for 'New York City'
  - capitalizations do not matter, guesses and answers are not case-sensitive
  - accented symbols **should not** matter: eg. Montreal == Montr√©al
- Submit your guess and you will be greeted with the next picture, the previous round's outcome, and an updated scoreboard!

## Deployment
